<p><b>1. HEADINGS</b></p>
<h1><b>You can write your thoughts here</b></h1>
<p></p>

<h2><b>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</b></h1>

<p></p>
<h3><b>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</b></h1>

<p></p>
<h4><b>I mean, like what is his deal?</b></h1>

<p></p>
<h5><b>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero?  Weird...</b></h1>

<p><b>2. NESTING</b></p>
<p></p>This exercise is about nesting div tags
This div contains this text and the div tag below.
<p></p>Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs.

    <div><ul>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us.  Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</ul>
    <div><ul>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us.  Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</ul></div>

<p><b>3. LISTS</b></p>
    <p>This exercise is about making lists
Here's what I like about lists:</p>

<li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
<li>That's about it</li>
<li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing three things in threes is cool</li>
<p></p>

<p>When you make lists do it in this order:</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>1. Decide if it's an ordered list or not</p>
<p>2. If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</p>
    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
            <ol>1. Curveball! You can nest lists inside each otherwise</ol>
<p>3. You've got this, I believe in you!</p>

<p><b>4. LINES</b></p>
<h2><b>Lines. So many lines. </b></h2>

<p></p>
<hr><hr/><hr><hr/><hr><hr/><hr><hr/><hr><hr/>

<p>I'm so sorry...</p>

<p><b>5. STYLING TEXT</b></p>
Here's a couple of ways you can express yourself:
<p><li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
<p><li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></l></p>
<p><li><b>If you want to sound annoying, use the bold tag</b></li></p> 
<p>You did it! You should be proud of yourself.</p>
